    <strong>Introduction</strong> &mdash; <strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/2-timothy-3-12.html">2 Timothy 3:12</a></strong>:  Everyone who wants to live as a disciple will be persecuted.
    <br>
    <ol>
    	<li><strong>Jesus was persecuted.</strong>
        	<ol>
            	<li><strong>Family</strong>
                	<ol>
                    	<li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/mark-3-20-21.html">Mark 3:20-21</a></strong>:  Jesus' family thought that he was out of His mind (brain washed; mind-control).</li>
                        <li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/mark-3-31-35.html">Mark 3:31-35</a></strong>:  Jesus prioritized His spiritual family above His physical family.</li>
                        <li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/acts-1-12-14.html">Acts 1:12-14</a></strong>:  This conviction produces conflict.  However, after His resurrection and ascension, His mother and brothers were disciples.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Gossip and slander</strong>
                	<ol>
                    	<li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/john-7-12-13.html">John 7:12-13</a></strong>:  Jesus was accused of deceiving people.</li>
                        <li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/john-10-19-21.html">John 10:19-21</a></strong>:  The Jews &mdash; religious people &mdash; intensely persecuted Jesus through name-calling and character assassination.  Jesus' teaching always divided His listeners.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scope of persecution</strong>
                	<ol>
                    	<li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/luke-23-1-3.html">Luke 23:1-3</a></strong>:  Jesus is condemned to a death by crucifixion through half-truths.</li>
                        <li>Jesus &mdash; who was perfect &mdash; was falsely accused and misunderstood by His family and killed by religious leaders.  What do you think will happen to you if you follow Jesus?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The First Century Church was persecuted.</strong>
        	<ol>
            	<li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/acts-5-17-18-38-42.html">Acts 5:17-18, 38-42</a></strong>
                	<ol>
                    	<li>The Jewish leadership arrested the apostles for preaching the Word, because of jealousy.</li>
                        <li>Those who persecuted the Christians thought that they were doing this for God, though in fact they were fighting against Him.</li>
                        <li>The apostles suffered physical mistreatment.</li>
                        <li>Persecution did not stop the disciples from daily proclamation.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/acts-28-21-22.html">Acts 28:21-22</a></strong>
                	<ol>
                    	<li>Everywhere, the church was highly controversial.</li>
                        <li>The church was called a "sect" (cult).</li>
                        <li>Since the International Christian Churches have the goal of imitating Jesus and the first century church, what will happen to us?  If a church is not being persecuted, what does that imply?</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                            	<li>Jesus warns that persecution comes to those who preach the same message as Him.</li>
                                <li>Jesus warns that the price of hatred is certain, and perhaps even death.</li>

                                <li>We do not condemn the lost; they are condemned already.  However, when the lost are confronted doctrinally about their condition before God, they will repent, run or persecute.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Satan is behind all persecution.  Only God and His spiritual armor will give you the victory over the world.</li>

            </ol>

        <li><strong>Conclusion</strong> &mdash; The International Christian Churches are a controversial Christian movement.  Some call us a cult and accuse us of both brain-washing and mind-control.  Many false rumors and half-truths have been spread.  Newspaper articles, television shows and especially the internet have slandered the ICC, and yet, the facts are that lives have been radically changed, marriages have been healed, drug addicts have been freed, the poor have been fed and cared for, and this rapidly growing movement &mdash; The SoldOut Movement &mdash; is spreading around the world in this generation!  Just like the first century!</li>

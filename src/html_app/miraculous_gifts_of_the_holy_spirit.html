Great persecution breaks out.  Many leave, but apostles stay in Jerusalem.

When apostles come to Samaria, Simon saw that the Spirit's gifts were only given by apostles' laying on of hands and offers them money for this ability (</span><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/acts-8-18.html"><span id = "phrases.p47">Acts 8:18</span></a></strong><span id = "phrases.p48">).

        	<ol>
            	<li><span id = "phrases.p56">Apostles were able to pass on the gifts because they were apostles.  The Apostles possessed the ability to perform miracles even during the ministry of Christ (</span><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/luke-9-1.html"><span id = "phrases.p57">Luke 9:1</span></a></strong><span id = "phrases.p58">).  This ability to pass and perform the gifts was not given at Pentecost.</span></li>

Thus the concept of a "Pentecostal church" (every member speaking in tongues) is contrary to Scripture.</span></li>
                <li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/1-corinthians-13-8-10.html"><span id = "phrases.p66">1 Corinthians 13:8-10</span></a></strong><span id = "phrases.p67">:  "Perfection" here could not mean the coming of Christ because it is in the neuter gender in Greek, not the masculine gender.  When perfection comes probably refers to the canonization of the Bible some time after the first century.  At that time, all the miraculous gifts would be gone because all the apostles and those to whom they passed the gifts would have died.</span></li>

                <li><strong><a data-rel="dialog" href="scriptures/2-thessalonians-2-9-12.html"><span id = "phrases.p74">2 Thessalonians 2:9-12</span></a></strong><span id = "phrases.p75"> shows that there can be miracles by Satan today.  Satan's purpose is to deceive people about the truth, so they will not be saved.</span></li>
                <li><span id = "phrases.p76">Speaking in "tongues" is common in many religions (Mormon, Catholic, Islam, etc.), because religion gets dried and staid.  These are also called "ecstatic utterances" &mdash; non-understandable sounds and fragments of speech.</span></li>
